# Devlog, March 2025

- fixed some issues with linting and formatting -- these were breaking the Nuxt VSCode extension and causing all manner of trouble
- moved my personal todo list and knowledge base from Apple Reminders to [Things](https://culturedcode.com/things/) to [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), basically ending up with something similar to Things that handles notes too
- added [nuxt-llms](https://github.com/nuxtlabs/nuxt-llms) for no reason -- but perhaps I can feed the output into an LLM to instantly create an AI therapist
- went through all the "trip" records in detail, found a bunch of issues that were caused by bad data -- one fun thing was noting [the very precise time](/source/c205205/data/homes.ts) for my move from Seattle to SF, so that flight wasn't included in a trip
- selected [the trips](/source/c205205/content/trips) that seem like signifigant life moments -- wrote a little about each and dug up what photos I could, this was quite a slog
- updated [nuxt-trpc](https://trpc-nuxt.pages.dev/) to the release version -- still such a cool piece of this project
- watched [The Accountant](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Accountant_(2016_film)>) and added support for responsive images to the blog feature:
