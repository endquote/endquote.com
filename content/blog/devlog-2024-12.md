# Devlog, December 2024

December's [inspiration and motivation](./getting-back-to-building.md) was combined with a few tech discoveries that helped get the ball rolling on an initial goal of rebuilding endquote.com once again. Step one on these projects is always "what CMS should I use," with the answer almost always being "I'll build my own from scratch."

The discovery of [Nuxt Content](https://content.nuxt.com) kept me from making that terrible decision. I like that you edit content in markdown/json, but work with it using a real sqlite database.

I made a schema of objects like "roles", "projects", "honors", and "awards" that make up the contents of the [about](/about) and [projects](/projects) pages. While it's a real database underneath ([and in the browser?](https://content.nuxt.com/docs/advanced/database#wasm-sqlite-in-browser)), relationships between entities aren't enforced, so those had to be manually maintained and refactored several times.

All good, but I've never used Vue or [Nuxt](https://nuxt.com/) before, and it looks like I've bought into that platform now. I did the incredibly wild thing of actually reading the documentation end-to-end before diving in. I started to get why some folks prefer Vue to React -- it seems simpler in general and harder to do the "wrong" thing even in simple components. I do think the template syntax (`<variables :are="quoted">sometimes, but not {{others}}</variables>`) is weird in parts compared to JSX, but I get it.

While I don't really need a big component library, the next thing to learn was [Nuxt UI](https://ui3.nuxt.dev/) mainly because it seemed like the easiest way to integrate [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/). So at this point I'm running Nuxt 3 in a mode that opts into features from the unreleased Nuxt 4, an alpha version of Nuxt Content 3, and an alpha of Nuxt UI 3 which references a beta of Tailwind 4. And I've never used any of these libraries before. Let's roll.

I had a goal of getting a dupe of my site up by end of year. On one hand I made it easy on myself by keeping the same (lack of) design and content, but put it on hard mode by using all this new-to-me tech.

But that's ok because we have AI now, and according to all of the hype, I'll just have to describe what I want and it'll all appear before my eyes. While I did try [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com) for a while before settling on [Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot), that certainly hasn't been my experience with the AI tools. While I have been delighted by the ability to get mostly-good outputs for things like "give me the Tailwind CSS for a layout like this", or "help me build an [image carousel](/projects/sphere)" (why doesn't Nuxt UI have one?), I've also had the AI steer me in wildly wrong directions which I pursued for hours because I didn't know any better.

I'm still not sure if the tools aren't that great yet or I'm just holding it wrong, but I do see improvements with different models. Will keep trying.

My two weeks off work over the holidays was spent on all of that, celebrating two birthdays, and a quick trip to [Sea Ranch](https://www.thesearanchlodge.com). I get the site up on [Jan 1](https://bsky.app/profile/endquote.com/post/3lerlwawnjc2d) and have been tweaking it almost daily since.
