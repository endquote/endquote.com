**Hi, I'm Josh.** I use my engineering experience and design sense to [manage teams](/about) that create incredible user experiences in unconventional contexts.

Today I'm at Sony Interactive Entertainment ([PlayStation](https://www.playstation.com/)) helping the UX design division create the most-desired gaming products.

My [other work](/projects) includes museum exhibits, consumer products, immersive environments, and strange experiments on screens sized between inches and acres.

I live in San Francisco with my partner [Mary](https://crumbsinmyhandbag.com/) and my dog [Penrose](https://www.instagram.com/penrose.pup/). Outside of work I follow the worlds of art and fashion, particularly where they intersect with technology.
