# Hong Kong with McKinsey

At [Stimulant](/roles/stimulant-2010) we built, basically, an immersive app for doing corporate mergers and re-orgs? Which seemed absurd at the time, but now that I'm in corporate life seems kind of useful. The client was [McKinsey](https://www.mckinsey.com/) and it was shown at an internal conference in Hong Kong. My second trip to Asia and the first time rolling business class with the high-powered consulting world.
