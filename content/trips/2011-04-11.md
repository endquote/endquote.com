# MIX11, Robyn, CMKY

A pretty epic week. Went to Vegas with [Stimulant](/roles/stimulant-2010) for [Microsoft's MIX11 event](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIX_(Microsoft)#MIX_11>). We were on a panel to talk about "the future of natural user interfaces".

I hadn't planned it, but when I discovered Robyn was playing the next night, I stayed longer for the rooftop concert. It was pretty wild.

From there I went on to Denver for [the Communikey festival](https://cmky.org/festival/) with the Seattle rave friends. (But I have no photos of the festival for some reason?)
