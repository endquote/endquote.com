# MINI Pickup

The 2-door MINI Cooper is literally the only car that will fit in my parking spot, and after much debate I decided to spring for the loaded electric one. They were very hard to get during peak COVID, so I had to fly to LA to get one and drive it up. It's turned out to be perfect for us, Penrose fits great in the back.
