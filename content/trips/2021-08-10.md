# New Orleans

Went to New Orleans just for fun. A highlight was the sculpture garden at the New Orleans Museum of Art, which we didn't even know was there. "We should bring an umbrella," she said. "It'll be fine," I said. It rained. We also had a cancelled flight on the way back, which made the trip home kind of miserable. Good time otherwise, though!
