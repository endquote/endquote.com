# Solo trip to New York

I stayed in an AirBnB in Williamsburg, with the owner of the apartment still there, which was super awkward. Visited [Storm King](https://stormking.org/) for the first time, coincidentally on the day that Instagram Stories launched, so I posted from there while riding a bike around the grounds.

[Manus x Machina](https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2016/manus-x-machina) at the Met was another highlight. Visited [the OWO project](/projects/one-world-observatory) in person. Saw [Steve Powers](https://firstandfifteenth.net/) at Coney Island and [the Brooklyn Museum](https://www.brooklynmuseum.org/exhibitions/stephen_powers_coney_island). Even made it out to [Dia:Beacon](https://www.diaart.org/visit/visit-our-locations-sites/dia-beacon-beacon-united-states).

Went to so many museums, galleries, and shops that I started to see retail spaces and art spaces as pretty much the same thing.
