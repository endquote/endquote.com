# 30th Birthday in Mexico

A group of friends booked [a house](https://sanpanchorentals.com/properties/casa-linda/) in San Pancho for a few days for my birthday. Looking back at the photos I see there was a hamburger cake for some reason, I was wearing some strange hats, and I was friends with a bunch of folks that I've lost touch with.

It was [Darren's](https://www.linkedin.com/in/darrendavid) themed wedding that same week, so we went to that as well.
