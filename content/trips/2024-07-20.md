# London, Copenhagen, Stockholm

London for work, then split a week between Copenhagen and Stockholm. [Hotel Frantz](https://www.hotelfrantz.com/) was cute (but those stairs...), and the [Maurizio Cattelan exhibit](https://www.modernamuseet.se/stockholm/en/exhibitions/maurizio-cattelan-the-third-hand/) was a highlight. Plus we got to shop at [Acne Studios](https://www.acnestudios.com/) properly.
