# Eurotrip 2012

This epic Eurotrip started with a missed connection between Reykjavik and Paris, which led to some temporarily lost luggage. We went on to Barcelona and Rome, got tired of janky AirBnBs and discovered [a resort](https://www.lasuiteresort.com) on the island of [Procida](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procida) instead. Then some raving in [Split](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Split,_Croatia) before the journey back to Seattle.
