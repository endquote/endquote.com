# New York Art Trip

I went pretty hard for this week in New York, starting with a car rental and trip out to [MASS MoCA](https://massmoca.org/) to see their epic [Sol LeWitt retrospective](https://massmoca.org/sol-lewitt/), which eventually led to building my own [Drawing Series interactive piece](https://drawing-series.endquote.com). Back on Manhattan, I got to the [Rei Kawakubo show at the Met](https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2017/rei-kawakubo) and the last day of the [Whitney Biennial](https://whitney.org/exhibitions/2017-biennial). Somehow I also made it to [a concert in Prospect Park](https://www.prospectpark.org/visit-the-park/things-to-do/celebrate-brooklyn/) with friends Mia and Maria.
