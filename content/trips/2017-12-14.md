# Day for Night

Went to Houston for the [Day for Night](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Day_for_Night_(festival)>) festival, which was epic but sadly never held again. A couple of the epic media pieces there were a [Bot & Dolly performance](https://youtu.be/lX6JcybgDFo?si=3oj2Sh-EbcONIEBc) and the legendary [Light Leaks](https://github.com/kylemcdonald/LightLeaks) by Kyle McDonald. I got there a little early to visit [The Menil Collection](https://www.menil.org) and [Rothko Chapel](https://www.rothkochapel.org). Who knew Houston was such an art town.
