# Tokyo, Hakone, Seto Sea, Hong Kong

My first and still most magical trip to Japan. We hit [teamLab Borderless](https://www.teamlab.art/e/tokyo/) before heading to an onsen in Hakone. We eventually completed the trek to Naoshima to stay at [Benesse House](https://benesse-artsite.jp/en/stay/), literally spending the night in the museum. Visiting the various "art islands" was life-changing and I can't wait to go back. And then, no big deal, we just popped off to an epic wedding in Hong Kong.
