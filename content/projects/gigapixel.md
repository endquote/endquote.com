A series of touch screen kiosks which let visitors pan and zoom around a massive 360Â° image of Philadelphia. Day and night images are synced together and dotted with points of interest organized by category, each with copy and a slide show. All text and UI is available in multiple languages.

**My contribution:** I managed hardware and software engineering, QA, content integration, deployment, and support.
