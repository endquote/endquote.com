A platform on which to build experiences which respond to guest interaction in physical space. Multiple sensing technologies including depth/RGB cameras, beacons, and UWB are aggregated into a single coordinate space and event stream. A guests' session can begin with a website click, persist when they enter a physical space, and influence immersive installations. Implemented as decoupled micro-services which can theoretically scale to an infinitely large physical space.

**My contribution:** I conceived of the project, designed the architecture, and built both the back-end services and front-end interfaces.
