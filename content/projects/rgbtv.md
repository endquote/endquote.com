I love digital and installation art, but wanted to enjoy it at home. I developed a digital signage system which accepts links to videos from around the web and plays them offline. Content can be grouped into channels with multiple displays playing the same or different channels. A physical rotary controller allows for seeking, skipping, muting, and displaying metadata.

**My contribution:** I conceived of the project, developed and deployed it.
