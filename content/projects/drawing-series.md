An interactive exploration of Sol LeWitt's "Drawing Series", one of the groups of his many Wall Drawings, produced beginning in 1960. I wrote a script which procedurally generated all of the drawings as SVG, rasterized them to massive bitmaps, and split them into image pyramids to be navigated with [OpenLayers](https://openlayers.org). The drawing methods, styles, and series can be browsed spatially. Each drawing can also be viewed on its own, with links back to the overall map.
