[An open-source project](https://github.com/stimulant/ampm) to perform application management and performance monitoring for Stimulant's installation projects. The tool launches application processes, restarts them if there's an error, and collects logging and analytics information. Deployed in many Stimulant projects and used by other agencies as well.

**My contribution:** I conceived of, architected, implemented, and supported the tool.
