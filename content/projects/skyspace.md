[Stimulant](https://www.stimulant.com/work/skyspace-la-immersive-virtual-tour) designed and implemented a 360° projection theater which tracked visitors via a series of cameras in the ceiling and responded with 3D animations and LED lighting. An adjacent disused elevator shaft reflected visitor silhouettes as a swirl of particles for selfies. In between, an infinity mirror lit up when guests walked on it, with unique lighting schemes for every occasion. A custom show control system tied it all together and let staff run the exhibits from a tablet.

**My contribution:** I coordinated a team of freelance and full-time software engineers, hardware integrators, and testers. [My own tools](/projects/ampm) were used for deployment and support, and I engineered [the show control system](/projects/ringmaster). I was the primary technical interface between engineering, creative, and the client.
