We designed and implemented a series of exhibits to educate visitors on the history of Intel and the chip manufacturing process. The software platform evolved over the years, from Silverlight to Unity to [Cinder](https://www.libcinder.org/). Some exhibits were augmented with presence-sensing depth cameras, physical controls and buttons, and content moderation tools.

**My contribution:** I coordinated a team of freelance and full-time software engineers, hardware integrators, and testers. [My own tools](/projects/ampm) were used for deployment and support, and I engineered content moderation tools. I was the primary technical interface between engineering, creative, and the client.
