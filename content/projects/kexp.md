Microsoft commissioned an animated visualization of [KEXP's](https://www.kexp.org) playlist data and album art going back for years. Certain interactions could be automated, with the frame rate recorded and used to generate a GPU benchmark.

**My contribution:** I developed the software for scraping the playlist info and displaying the visualization.
