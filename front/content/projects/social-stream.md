An application which aggregates content from RSS, Twitter, and Flickr, and displays those items as an endless stream of news. Items can be pulled from the stream for closer examination and saved to a mobile device. A companion application customizes the look and content of the application for various contexts.

**My contribution:** I architected and implemented the application.
