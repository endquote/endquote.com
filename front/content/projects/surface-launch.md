I spent some time at Microsoft working on the as-yet-unannounced [Microsoft Surface touch table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_PixelSense) product. I was in the Surface design studio and, without an official SDK, developed a number of high-polish proof-of-concept apps envisioning retail and restaurant scenarios. These were presented by Bill Gates on the Today Show and by Steve Ballmer at the D5 conference in 2007.

**My contribution:** I architected and implemented several applications using internal SDKs.
