This touch screen digital signage system from [Stimulant](https://www.stimulant.com/work/genentech-interactive-lobby-dashboards) on Genentech's campus is running in seven building lobbies, each with a different configuration of displays and touch sensors. The content is a blend of items from Twitter, building sensors, and the company intranet.

**My contribution:** I managed the development effort, performed QA, was the main client contact during development, and performed on-site installation.
