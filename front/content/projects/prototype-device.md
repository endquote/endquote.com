The brand's innovation team had a seed of an idea which we expanded to a physical prototype and a suite of applications to run on it. High-quality video streams from DSLR cameras were merged with depth data to create large-scale, headset-free augmented reality experiences. Users interacted with voice, touch, gesture, and mobile devices.

**My contribution:** I coordinated a team of freelance and full-time software engineers, hardware integrators, and testers. [My own tools](/projects/ampm) were used for deployment and support. I was the primary technical interface between engineering, creative, and the client.
