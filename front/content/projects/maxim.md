A six-screen touch wall in the lobby of a chip manufacturer's new corporate headquarters included generative and touch-reactive graphics as an ambient mode, and a playful way to navigate content describing the company's history and products.

**My contribution:** I was the sole developer and assisted with on-site deployment and warranty support.
