An application which used low-level Windows graphics APIs to display a multi-touch application switcher. The tool was used to allow meeting participants to queue up content and literally throw applications, websites, and other documents onto one of three massive shared screens, controlled by a Cisco CTS3000 Telepresence Suite.

**My contribution:** I architected and implemented the application.
