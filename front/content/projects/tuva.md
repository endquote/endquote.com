An interactive video experience which annotates lectures with images, links, and transcripts. Students can save their progress through the videos as well as take time-synced notes within the application. The project launched with Richard Feynmanâ€™s Messenger Series lectures, a cornerstone set of seven talks at Cornell University in 1964.

**My contribution:** I architected and implemented the application.
