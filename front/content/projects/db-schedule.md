Deployed across multiple venues during a Seattle music festival, the signage displayed upcoming performance schedules and social media content scraped from the web. Organizers could inject announcements as the event went on. A series of generative backgrounds reacted in realtime to the music.

**My contribution:** I conceived of the project and implemented all software components.
