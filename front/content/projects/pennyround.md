The kitchen tile in my home is a pattern called "penny round" that seemed fun to project on. I developed a calibration system and drawing tool using React and [two.js](https://two.js.org), then animated a "show" using [GSAP](https://gsap.com/). The algorithm computes all possible lines through the area from the tiles that intersect with the outer cabinets. A very basic [ViewSonic M1 projector](https://www.viewsonic.com/us/m1mini-ultra-portable-led-projector-with-jbl-speaker-hdmi-and-usb.html#specs) on the kitchen counter provided the light.
