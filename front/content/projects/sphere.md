Before construction of [MSG Sphere](https://www.thesphere.com/) in Las Vegas had begun, my team was tasked with creating environments to simulate playback of 16k content on a unique display. In a San Francisco warehouse we created three installations. One was a large section of LED which matched the scale and material of Sphere, the second was a video wall of consumer LCD panels that matched the resolution and playback requirements, and the third was a laser projection dome that matched the form factor. Each of these then required systems to manage the ingestion, playback, and control of content.

**My contribution:** I managed the team that designed, implemented, and maintained the installations.
