An in-store experience for a mobile network which let customers place mobile devices on a table to learn their details and specifications. When two devices were placed near each other, relevant specs could be compared side-by side. Info about devices as well as service plans were stored in a custom CMS and deployed to all stores nightly.

**My contribution:** I architected and implemented the application.
