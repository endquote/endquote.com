An experimental music sequencer which used a collection of physical cubes, each with a one-inch, 128x128 screen, and the ability to sense its neighboring devices. One cube kept the master sequence, and the others were individual instruments. This was a launch app for the Sifteo platform.

**My contribution:** I implemented the software on the devices and collaborated with the Sifteo team on their C# SDK.
