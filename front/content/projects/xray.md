An experiment in using mobile displays as lenses into the content on a larger fixed display. When a mobile phone is placed on the table top, it's detected and sent an image representing an alternative view of the content displayed beneath it. Multiple simultaneous devices are supported.

**My contribution:** I conceived of, architected, and implemented the application.
