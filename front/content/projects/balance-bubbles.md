An original [Surface table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_PixelSense) was modified to sit on top of a [Wii Balance Board](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wii_Balance_Board) and connected via a reverse-engineered Bluetooth protocol. Weight on the edges of the table was detected by the scale and added forces to a physics simulation on the display.

**My contribution:** I conceived of, architected, and implemented the application.
