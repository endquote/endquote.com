A series of touch screen kiosks which let visitors pan and zoom around a massive 360Â° image of Seattle, dotted with points of interest organized by category, each with copy and a slide show. A second experience teleports guests to insider locations around the city with immersive video.

**My contribution:** I managed hardware and software engineering, QA, content integration, deployment, and support.
