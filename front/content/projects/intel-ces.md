Conference attendees could use any of six custom-made stations to scan an object. From this silhouette, a unique life form was created on a 2200 square-foot, non-uniform, projection-mapped surface, using 24 projectors. Built at [Stimulant](https://www.stimulant.com/work/intel-interactive-tradeshow-booth) for [Foghorn Creative](https://www.foghorncreative.com/).

**My contribution:** I implemented the software at for the input stations, as well as health-monitoring tools for the larger installation.
