I've been a fan of the work of [The Designers Republic](https://www.thedesignersrepublic.com) since forever, and became intrigued when they opened up a Discord server and [NFT project](https://www.tdrbingo.com). I was [the first to mint](https://opensea.io/assets/ethereum/0xcb6b570b8aeabe38b449aff31f901b8e1b91e396/4), but the project had a slow and mysterious reveal. Members of the community started to piece together how the tokens were related and came up with a manually-created pyramid visualization. Of course I had to build it in code, combining the high-resolution artwork into a \~9 gigapixel image pyramid. The best parts are the keyboard navigation between tokens, and the responsive mobile layout.
