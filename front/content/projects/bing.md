The second-generation Surface table shipped with one application, Bing. It was meant to be used in public spaces and could route visitors to a destination on a map, or provide image search results in a novel way. Multiple users could perform tasks on the same display simultaneously. The source code was eventually released and some of the UI elements were granted patents.

**My contribution:** I architected and implemented the application.
