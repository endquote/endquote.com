A high-resolution Bluetooth sensor network was installed throughout a full-scale mockup of a retail showroom for a major automotive brand. A series of seven touch screen exhibits guided visitors through a purchase, with BLE tracking enabling a persistent session across each one. A mobile exhibit reflected information about a vehicle as guests walked around it. Administrators could view reports and heat maps of guest journeys over time. A collaboration between [Stimulant](https://stimulant.com), [8](https://eightinc.com) and [11](https://www.linkedin.com/company/eleveninc/).

**My contribution:** I coordinated a team of freelance and full-time software engineers, hardware integrators, and testers. [My own tools](/projects/ampm) were used for deployment and support. I was the primary technical interface between engineering, creative, and the client.
