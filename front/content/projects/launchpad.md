This wide-screen display from [Stimulant](https://www.stimulant.com/work/mohai-bezos-center-for-innovation) is behind a mirrored surface and augmented with depth cameras, reflecting the guest's image and a particle silhouette as they approach to play with a number of mini-games that inspire innovation and collaboration.

**My contribution:** I managed engineering, QA, and deployment.
