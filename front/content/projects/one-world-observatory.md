A 65' by 16' projection from [Stimulant](https://www.stimulant.com/work/one-world-nyc) greets visitors to the tower by highlighting their origin on a 3D world map and welcoming them in their native language. The experience consists of a [Cinder](https://www.libcinder.org/) application running at 8k resolution and a Node.js server which gets ticket sale and scan data in real time. Millions of visitors have been tracked by the system so far.

**My contribution:** I managed the development, QA, and deployment teams, and assisted with warranty support.
