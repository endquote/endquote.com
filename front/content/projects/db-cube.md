Microsoft created a sculpture that was projected on from within, including integrated Kinect sensors on four sides. We visualized the skeletons of dancers on all sides, connecting the limbs of those on opposite sides of the cube. It was installed in the main venue of [Decibel Festival](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decibel_Festival), and reacted to the audio in real-time.

**My contribution:** I managed engineering, QA, and deployment, and was the technical contact with the clients.
